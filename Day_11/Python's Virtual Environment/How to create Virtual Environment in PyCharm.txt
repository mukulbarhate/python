how to check your project location?

view
	tools window
		terminal

here command prompt will appear which shows your project location.
e.g
PS C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects\pythonProject>
	this is also called as "global environment"



how to check what all libraries you have installed inside "global environment"?

give following command inside terminal command prompt:

PS C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects\pythonProject> pip list

it will list out all the libraries you've installed inside global environment.

how will you create a virtual environment inside your project?

first change the terminal from "Power Shell" to cmd.exe, for that :

file
	settings
		tools
			terminal

				shell path -  change to  cmd.exe

come inside your project

click on the terminal option from the bottom window

make sure now it shows:

C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects\pythonProject>

	it proves that you've changed your terminal from "Power Shell (PS)" to cmd.

now, in order to create virtual environment give following command:

C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects\pythonProject> python -m venv venv

it will take few seconds

After creating the virtual environment, you need to activate it. In the terminal, give following command:

C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects\pythonProject> venv\Scripts\activate

make sure terminal window shows:

(venv) C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects\pythonProject>

it means you've activated your virtual environment.

in order to list the available libraries inside the virtual environment, give following command:

(venv) C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects\pythonProject> pip list

you will not see any libraries here. You may install later.

To deactivate the virtual environment and return to the project folder, simply type deactivate in the terminal and press Enter.

i.e.

(venv) C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects\pythonProject> deactivate

make sure terminal now shows:

C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects\pythonProject>
