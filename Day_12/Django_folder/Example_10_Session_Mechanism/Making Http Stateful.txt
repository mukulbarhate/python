Http is a stateless protocol.
client requests a web resource.

when client requests a web resource again or to another web resource, for the server it is a different client altogether.
i.e. server does not remember client after the response is given to client back.

in a practical scenario mostly we have a requirement where server should remember client. e.g. shopping cart example. i.e. we have a requirement of making Http stateful.

Session is one of the mechanisms using which we can make Http as a stateful protocol.
