In your templates, use the static template tag to build the URL for the given relative path using the configured staticfiles STORAGES alias.

{% load static %}

<img src="{% static 'my_app/example.jpg' %}" alt="My image">

Store your static files in a folder called static in your app. 

For example my_app/static/my_app/example.jpg.

Your project will probably also have static assets that arenâ€™t tied to a particular app. In addition to using a static/ directory inside your apps, you can define a list of directories (STATICFILES_DIRS) in your settings file where Django will also look for static files. 

For example:
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / "static",
    "/var/www/static/",
]
