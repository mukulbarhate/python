// assuming virtual environment is created and Django has been installed inside it.

activate your virtual environment

e:\work\myenv> scripts\activate

(myenv) PS E:\work\myenv>

create a project:

(myenv) PS E:\work\myenv> django-admin startproject myproject

make sure "myproject" project has been created inside "myenv" ( this can be checked inside VS code itself)

now inside this "myproject" we'll create our first app or application. One application atleast is required.

go to "myproject"

(myenv) PS E:\work\myenv> cd myproject
(myenv) PS E:\work\myenv\myproject> 

now create app inside this

(myenv) PS E:\work\myenv\myproject> django-admin startapp firstapp

make sure inside "myproject", "firstapp" gets created



right click on "firstapp"
	new python file
		urls.py

blank "urls.py" file will get created. Now copy the contens of "urls.py" file from "myproject" folder and paste it in "urls.py" of "firstapp" project.

inside "urlpatterns" of "urls.py" file of "firstapp" 

path=
	which has got 3 parameters
	1) the endpoint of the page
		if it is blank that means we want to display "Hello World" on the home page itself.
	2) on the execution of the app, which function should be called
		e.g. if you mention "views.home"
	it means definition of "home" function you will provide in "views.py" file.

if you get error for "views" ,
	from . import views

	3) name 
		which is name of page e.g.  home page

so , your "urls.py" inside "firstapp" should look like

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',views.home,name='home page')
]


let's go to "views.py" and define "home" function

contents of "views.py" file:

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to first Django app")



now project "myproject" within which we have "firstapp", should know that we've created url.

so open "urls.py" of "myproject" and include the url we have given inside "urls.py" of "firstapp"

so "urls.py" of "myproject" should look like:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path,include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',include('firstapp.urls'))
]


now start the server

on terminal go to "e:\work\myenv\myproject>" and type the following command:

python manage.py runserver

make sure you get following message:

	Django version 4.2, using settings 'a.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/


click this link and make sure you get following message in the browser:

	Welcome to first Django app
