	Client						Server

						1) should be ready


    2) client must know name(IP address)
	of the server and port no. on which 
	required application is running.

What is port no?
	
	on Server we have different applications running e.g. tomcat server, oracle server,weblogic server etc. 
	These applications are differentiated from each other with the help of port no.
	So when we say Client would like to connect to the server, it is for a particular application (tomcat server , oracle server etc). And that client can specify with the help of port no.
	


3) how the data travels from Client to Server and vice-versa ?
	
	a) Data gets converted into Packets [ marshalling ]

	b) Packets are delivered on the other side of network.

	c) Packets get converted into Data. [ unmarshalling ]
