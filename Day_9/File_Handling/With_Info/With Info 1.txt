The with statement in Python is used for resource management and exception handling. You’d most likely find it when working with file streams. 

The code block below shows the try-finally approach to file stream resource management.

file = open('file-path', 'w') 
try: 
    file.write('Lorem ipsum') 
finally: 
    file.close()
 
Normally, you’d want to use this method for writing to a file, but the with statement offers a cleaner approach:

with open('file-path', 'w') as file: 
    file.write('Lorem ipsum') 
The with statement simplifies our write process to just two lines.
