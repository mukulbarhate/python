given 2 2d arrays:

fourth=np.array([[10,20,30],[40,50,60]])
fifth=np.array([[70,80,90],[100,110,120]])

that means we have to see them together as one 3d array.
i.e.
main_array[2][2][3]
	i.e. we have two 2d arrays with [2][3]

so we have 3 dimensions here
first dimension (axis=0) means 
	main_array[2] which gives us two 2d arrays (main_array[0] and main_array[1]) completely.
axis=0 will give you two 2d arrays 
sum axis=0 will simply add two 2d arrays as if they are placed one after the other i.e. behind 10  , 70 will come so 10+70
behind 20, 80 will come so  20+80 and so on



second dimension (axis=1) means
	main_array[0][0] and main_array[0][1] give us two 1d arrays and  axis=1 here gives us axis=0 of single dimension arrays [ column-wise total ]

third dimension (axis=2) means
	it gives us axis=1 of single dimension arrays  [row-wise total]
