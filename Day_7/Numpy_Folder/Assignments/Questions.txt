1) create a list, accept 5 numbers , store them in the list and finally convert that list to numpy array.

2) create numpy array of 5 numbers and print their sum

3) create numpy double dimension array of 3*3 to store your initial and display them in a tabular form.

4) create one-d numpy array of 12 elements , accept 12 numbers and display them. Now convert this one-d array into (4*3) two-d array and display it in a tabular form.

5) create two double dimension array and arrange (stack) them using "axis=0" "axis=1" and  "axis=2".


6) create two one-d arrays and then find out:
	a) common elements of both the array
	b) unique elements of first array
	c) unique elements of second array

7) accept no.of rows and no. of cols from the user , create two-d array accordingly. Now calculate the sum as per "axis=0" and "axis=1"

8) declare two 2d arrays and calculate the sum as per "axis=0" "axis=1" and "axis=2"

9) create two-d array ,display it. Now accept a number from user and perform all arithmetic operations on each and every element of the array using that number.

10) accept start, end and how many numbers to be generated and then using "linspace" create numpy array.

11) create one-d array of 8 numbers and then using "slicing" concept,
	a) print numbers from 1 to 4
	b) print all the numbers from 3rd position
	c) print last 3 numbers

12) create 2 d array (4*3) with following values:
[[10,20,30,40],[50,60,70,80],[90,100,110,120]]

now using array slicing concept display following values
	a) display   50  60  70  80
	b) display 100 and 110
	c) display 30 70 and 110
	d) display 50  60  90 and 100
