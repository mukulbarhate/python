# with *dataclasses* module we no longer need to define *__init__* and *__str__* methods in our class, they are provided implicitly.


from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    height: float
    email: str


# p=Person() # TypeError: Person.__init__() missing 4 required positional arguments: 'name', 'age', 'height', and 'email'
# it's because , inside Person class __init__() method is internally provided which needs 4 arguments while
# creating an object

p=Person("Rohit",35,5.8,"rohit@gmail.com")  # __init__ method which is internally provided gets invoked here
print(p)  # also __str__() method is internally provided
