 create a package "mypack". inside this package, create:
	voting.py [module]
inside this module create:


class VotingNotAllowedException as a user defined exception class
	and
	

class Voter with
name and age
parameterized constructor will accept name ,age and check if the age is not >=18 , it will raise "VotingNotAllowedException"


Now create Python application which will instantiate "Voter" class and handle the exception.
