how does "for i in ref1:" work here?

it first invokes "__iter__()" method of MyNumber class.

	__iter__() method returns for loop the object of "MyNumber"

now for loop invokes "__next__()" method of MyNumber class which returns a number every time.
This number for loop stores inside "i" variable and then prints.
