# --------------------- Dictionary --------------------------
# 1) accept 5 students name and store them in the dictionary by providing keys from 1 to 5 respectively.
# student={}
# for i in range(1,6):
#     name=input(f"Enter {i} name: ")
#     student[i]=name

# print(student)
s1={}
print(type(s1))

# 2) create a dictionary with pairs
# 	soap:100
# 	deo:300
# 	perfume:400

# now accept a product name from user (in any case, so you have to handle "ignore case") and display its price. Also , if the product is not present in the dictionary display the error message " product not available "
# 	Note:  you should not get "KeyError:" in the program.





# 3) define a class "Student" with members
# 	name,age,address and qualification
	
#    define parameterized constructor and "str" member function which returns all the members

#    create 4 objects of Student by passing values.

# now create a dictionary with rollno ( start from 1 ) as a key and student object as a value.

# accept a rollno from user and display all its details i.e. name,age,address and qualification.
# also display message "student not found" in case if rollno entered by user is not available as a key inside the dictionary.

# 4)  Given a dictionary of students and their favourite colours: 
# people={'Arham':'Blue','Lisa':'Yellow',''Vinod:'Purple','Jenny':'Pink'} 
# 1. Find out how many students are in the list 
# 2. Change Lisaâ€™s favourite colour 
# 3. Remove 'Jenny' and her favourite color
# 4. Sort and print students and their favourite colours alphabetically by name





# ---------------------- TUPLE -----------------
# 1) Write a Python program to count the elements in a list until an element is a tuple.
# Sample input : list = [10, 20, 30, (40,50), 60]
# Sample output = 3
   


# 2) create a tuple to store 5 numbers and then sort it in ascending and descending order.

# 3) Write a Python program to find the repeated items of a tuple.



# ------------------------------ STRING ----------------------
# 1) accept a string and display whether it is palindrom or not.
