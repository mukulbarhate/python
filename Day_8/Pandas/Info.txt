Pandas stands for "Panel Data" and is the core library for data manipulation and data analysis.
It consists of single and multidimensional data-structures for data manipulation.
single dimensional data structure is known as "Series objects" and multi-dimensional data structure is known as "Data Frame".
In pandas, we can import data from various file formats like JSON, CSV(comma-separated values), Microsoft Excel, etc.

When we have to work on Tabular data, we prefer the pandas module.When we have to work on Numerical data, we prefer the numpy module.

The powerful tools of pandas are Data frame and Series.
Whereas the powerful tool of numpy is Arrays.
