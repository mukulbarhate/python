Python uses a hash "seed value" that is set when the interpreter starts. This hash seed is used as a "randomization factor" in the hash algorithm to help prevent certain types of denial-of-service attacks that exploit predictable hash values. Because the hash seed is randomly generated or derived from some runtime-specific factors, it can change between different executions of the Python interpreter, resulting in different hash values for the same strings.
