what is CORS?

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

What is origin?

	origin consists of "protocol" ,"domain" and "port"

	e.g. http://myserver.com:8000

here "http" - protocol
     "myserver.com" -  domain name
      8000 -  port


By default browsers prevent Ajax request from different origin.

CORS is a standard to relax the same origin policy.

It selectively allows cross origin requests while rejecting others.

how can we enable CORS?

	apply following annotation on the RestController class

	@CrossOrigin("http://localhost:4200")
		here "http://localhost:4200" is assumed to be a different origin from where you would like to allow access to your Rest Service/s.
