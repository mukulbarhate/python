ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It's a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems, particularly between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases. In simpler terms, it's a way to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm, where database tables are represented as classes, and rows in those tables are represented as objects. This abstraction simplifies database interactions for developers, as they can work with objects in their code rather than directly dealing with SQL queries and database operations. Popular ORM frameworks include SQLAlchemy for Python, Hibernate for Java, and Entity Framework for .NET.
