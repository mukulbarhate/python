from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
cors = CORS(app, resources={r"/api/*": {"origins": "http://example.com"}})  # Allow CORS for routes under /api only for http://example.com



In this example, CORS is enabled for routes under /api and only for requests originating from http://example.com. You can adjust the resources parameter of the CORS constructor to specify different routes and origins as needed for your application.
