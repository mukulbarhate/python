In Flask, 
app = Flask(__name__) 

creates a "Flask" class instance. 

Flask: Flask is a class provided by the Flask framework. It represents the Flask application.


__name__
	 __name__ is a special Python variable that represents the name of the current module. When you run a Python script directly, __name__ is set to '__main__'. When the script is imported as a module in another script, __name__ is set to the name of the module.


app = Flask(__name__)

	 This line creates a Flask class instance named "app" by passing the name of the current module (i.e. __name__). 
By using __name__, Flask knows where to look for templates, static files, and other resources relative to the current module.

So, app = Flask(__name__) creates a Flask application instance, which you can then use to 
	define routes
	handle requests
	and build your web application.
